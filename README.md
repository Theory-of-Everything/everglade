Everglade is a green based color scheme forked from
[everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) due to some conflicting
design ideas. This fork will attempt to maintain similar changes to upstream
everforest, but with no palette changes. This fork will also tweaks a variety of
filetypes and plugins.

The name will mostly likely stick to 'everglade'
